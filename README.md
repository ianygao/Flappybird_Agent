# Flappybird_Agent
A implemetion of a DQN(Deep-Q Learning) agent that plays Flappybird game.<br>
This work is based on the following repos:<br>
https://github.com/yenchenlin/DeepLearningFlappyBird   <br>
https://github.com/SukerZ/Playing-Flappy-Bird-by-DQN-on-PyTorch  <br>
The main improvement of this program is that it reduce the training time of the model by using torch.cuda semantics and visualize the learning performance of the agent.
