# Flappybird_Agent
A implemetion of a DQN agent that plays Flappybird game.
This work is based on the following repos:
https://github.com/yenchenlin/DeepLearningFlappyBird
https://github.com/SukerZ/Playing-Flappy-Bird-by-DQN-on-PyTorch
The main improvement of this program is that it reduce the training time of the model by using torch.cuda semantics and visualize the learning performance of the agent.
